Using Google books API:
------------------------
Search for a book by its title (example harry potter)

Request:
https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=harry+potter&intitle:harry+potter&orderBy:relevance&key=AIzaSyAyxCsgKzQ3pLUUhl2YkozLi8UJQI55Vd4

Response (JSON) contains:
Title
Authors
Publisher
Publication date
description
ISBN (10 and 13)
Category
Image links
Language
Preview link
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Goodreads API:
---------------------------------
Get information about a book given its ISBN.
There is a field called reviews_widget from the response which
is a div element with its styling and a link to preview reviews from goodreads

Request:
https://www.goodreads.com/book/isbn/9771423738?key=NwNSlVu7xFWbuomMXJhrzA

Response (XML):
ID
Title
ISBN (10 and 13)
Image URL
Small image
Publication year
Publication month
Publication day
Publisher
Language
Description
Average rating
Rating count
Number of pages
Authors
reviews widget (div element to embed within your page that showes reviews)
Buy links (list of links with online stores -> see note down for details)
Similar books (list of similar books)

Notes:
To use buy links you need to append ?book_id={ID} at the end of the given url 
for example
the returned link to buy from amazon is: https://www.goodreads.com/book_link/follow/1 
and book ID from response is 49869
Then the redirect link to amazon is: https://www.goodreads.com/book_link/follow/1?book_id=49869
I don't know why they didn't handle this!

So what i suggest is using Google API for title search as it will return some useful
books but only store ISBNs from them and then use Goodreads API to get
information about these ISBNs.

You can test above requests in postman or whatever to see the results exactly.

There is an API that gets all libraries locations that have the exact 
edition of the book using its ISBN called (worldcat oclc) 
but it's for commertial use only i tried to request an API key 
but it was refused so if you wanna try go ahead.
